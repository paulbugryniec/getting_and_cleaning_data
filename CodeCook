This code books describes the data used and transformations done by the script run_analysis.R

# Overview

The data used in this script is from the recordings of 30 subjects
performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors

# Data Used

The original data was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

and the files used are

X_test.txt
y_test.txt
subject_test.txt
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_train.txt
activity_labels.txt
features.txt

X_test.txt and X_train.txt are joined together to create the data set featuresData. The variables names for featuresData are taken from features.txt file. 

y_test.txt and y_train.txt are joined together to create the data set activityData. This has one variable and has been labelled “activity”. Each activity is given a descriptive label taken from the activity_labels.txt file.

subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt are joined together to create the data set subjectData.

featuresData, activityData and subjectData are joined together to create the dat dataset. 

The subDat dataset is a subset of the dat data set and includes only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

The variable names of subDat are given descriptive variable names using the following logic.
Prefix t == Time
Prefix f == Frequency
Acc == Accelerometer
Gyro == Gyroscope
Mag == Magnitude

The tidyData set is a summarisation of the subDat dataset showing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
